<a name="PREFACE"></a><h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Venice, &quot;the famous city in the sea,&quot; rising like enchantment from the
waves of the Adriatic, appeals to the imagination through a history
replete with dramatic incident; wherein power and revolution&mdash;conquest
and conspiracy&mdash;mystery and romance&mdash;dazzling splendour and judicial
murder alternate in every page. Thirteen hundred years witnessed the
growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated city; commencing in
the fifth century, when thousands of terrified fugitives sought refuge
in its numerous islands from the dreaded presence of Attila; and
terminating when the last of the Doges, in 1797, lowered for ever the
standard of St. Mark before the cannon of victorious Buonaparte. Venice
was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the
Adriatic is endeared by the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that has
trod the great public square, with its mosque-like cathedral, has not
pictured to himself the forms of the heroic Moor and the gentle
Desdemona? Who that has landed from his gondola to pace the Rialto, has
not brought before his &quot;mind's eye,&quot; the scowling brow of Shylock, when
proposing the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim? Shakespeare may
or may not have derived his plot of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, as some
suppose, from two separate stories contained in Italian novels; but if
such be the fact, he has so interwoven the double interest, that the two
currents flow naturally into a stream of unity.</p>

<p>In this play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of his most
perfect works&mdash;powerful in its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity.
While the language of the Jew is characterized by an assumption of
biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is
invested with a heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.</p>

<p>From the opening to the closing scene,&mdash;from the moment when we hear of
the sadness, prophetic of evil, which depresses the spirit of Antonio,
till we listen at the last to the &quot;playful prattling of two lovers in a
summer's evening,&quot; whose soft cadences are breathed through strains of
music,&mdash;all is a rapid succession of hope, fear, terror, and gladness;
exciting our sympathies now for the result of the merchant's danger; now
for the solution of a riddle on which hangs the fate of the wealthy
heiress; and now for the fugitive Jessica, who resigns her creed at the
shrine of womanly affection.</p>

<p>In the production of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> it has been my object to
combine with the poet's art a faithful representation of the picturesque
city; to render it again palpable to the traveller who actually gazed
upon the seat of its departed glory; and, at the same time, to exhibit
it to the student, who has never visited this once</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;&mdash;&mdash; pleasant place of all festivity,<br /></span>
<span>The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The far-famed place of St. Mark, with its ancient Church, the Kialto and
its Bridge, the Canals and Gondolas, the Historic Columns, the Ducal
Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively presented to the
spectator. Venice is re-peopled with the past, affording truth to the
eye, and reflection to the mind.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Princes of Morocco and Arragon at Belmont,
hitherto omitted, is restored, for the purpose of more strictly adhering
to the author's text, and of heightening the interest attached to the
episode of the caskets.</p>

<p>The costumes and customs are represented as existing about the year
1600, when Shakespeare wrote the play. The dresses are chiefly selected
from a work by Cesare Vecellio, entitled &quot;Degli Habiti Antichi e Moderni
di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1590;&quot; as well as from other
sources to be found in the British Museum, whence I derive my authority
for the procession of the Doge in the first scene. If the stage is to
be considered and upheld as an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look
as the principal teacher, to inculcate its most valuable lessons. It is,
therefore, a cause of self-gratulation, that I have on many occasions
been able, successfully, to present some of the works of the greatest
dramatic genius the world has known, to more of my countrymen than have
ever witnessed them within the same space of time; and let me hope it
will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride I feel at having
been so fortunate a medium between our national poet and the people of
England.</p>

Doge, in state, across the square</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p>ANTONIO, SALARINO, <i>and</i> SALANIO <i>come forward</i>.</p>

<i>Ant</i>. In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;<br />
It wearies me; you say, it wearies you;<br />
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br />
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<br />
I am to learn;<br />
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br />
That I have much ado to know myself.<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br />
There, where your argosies<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> with portly sail,<br />
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br />
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br />
That curt'sy to them, do them reverence,<br />
As they fly by them with their woven wings.<br />
<br />
<i>Sal</i>. Believe me, Sir, had I such venture forth,<br />
The better part of my affections would<br />
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br />
Plucking the grass,<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> to know where sits the wind;<br />
Peering in maps, for ports, and piers, and roads;<br />
And every object that might make me fear<br />
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,<br />
Would make me sad.<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. My wind, cooling my broth,<br />
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br />
What harm a wind too great might do at sea.<br />
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br />
But I should think of shallows and of flats;<br />
And see my wealthy Andrew<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> dock'd in sand,<br />
Vailing her high-top<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> lower than her ribs,<br />
To kiss her burial.<br />
Shall I have the thought<br />
To think on this? and shall I lack the thought<br />
That such a thing, bechanc'd, would make me sad?<br />
But tell not me; I know Antonio<br />
Is sad to think upon his merchandize.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br />
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br />
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br />
Upon the fortune of this present year:<br />
Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad.<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. Why, then, you are in love.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Fie, fie!<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. Not in love, neither? Then let us say you are sad,<br />
Because you are not merry: an 'twere as easy<br />
For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry,<br />
Because you are not sad.<br />
<br />
<i>Sal</i>. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<br />
Gratiano, and Lorenzo: Fare you well;<br />
We leave you now with better company.<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. I would have staid till I had made you merry,<br />
If worthier friends had not prevented me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Your worth is very dear in my regard.<br />
I take it your own business calls on you,<br />
And you embrace the occasion to depart.<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> BASSANIO, LORENZO, <i>and</i> GRATIANO.</p>

<i>Salar</i>. Good morrow, my good lords.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Good signiors, both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?<br />
You grow exceeding strange: Must it be so?<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.<br />
<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> SALARINO <i>and</i> SALANIO.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor</i>. My lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,<br />
We two will leave you; but at dinner-time<br />
I pray you have in mind where we must meet.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. I will not fail you.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. You look not well, Signor Antonio;<br />
You have too much respect upon the world:<br />
They lose it that do buy it with much care.<br />
Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;<br />
A stage, where every man must play a part,<br />
And mine a sad one.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. Let me play the fool:<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><br />
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;<br />
And let my liver rather heat with wine,<br />
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br />
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,<br />
Sit like his grandsire, cut in alabaster?<br />
Sleep when he wakes? and creep into the jaundice<br />
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,<br />
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks;&mdash;<br />
There are a sort of men, whose visages<br />
Do cream<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and mantle like a standing pond:<br />
And do a wilful stillness entertain,<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><br />
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion<br />
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;<br />
As who should say, '<i>I am Sir Oracle</i>,<br />
<i>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><br />
O, my Antonio, I do know of these,<br />
That therefore only are reputed wise<br />
For saying nothing; when I am very sure,<br />
If they should speak, 'twould almost damn those ears<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a><br />
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br />
I'll tell thee more of this another time:<br />
But fish not with this melancholy bait,<br />
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br />
Come, good Lorenzo:&mdash;Fare ye well, a while;<br />
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a><br />
<br />
<i>Lor</i>. Well, we will leave you, then, till dinner-time:<br />
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<br />
For Gratiano never lets me speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. Well, keep me company but two years more,<br />
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a><br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. Thanks, i'faith; for silence is only commendable<br />
In a neat's tongue dried,<a name="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and a maid not vendible.<br />
<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> GRATIANO <i>and</i> LORENZO.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Is that any thing now?<br />

<p><i>Bas</i>. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man
in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels
of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them; and when you, have
them they are not worth the search.</p>

<i>Ant</i>. Well; tell me now, what lady is the same<br />
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<br />
That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br />
How much I have disabled mine estate,<br />
By something showing a more swelling port<a name="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a><br />
Than my faint means would grant continuance.<br />
To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love;<br />
And from your love I have a warranty<br />
To unburthen all my plots and purposes,<br />
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br />
And, if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br />
Within the eye of honour, be assur'd<br />
My purse, my person, my extremest means,<br />
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft<br />
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br />
The self-same way, with more advised watch<br />
To find the other forth; and by adventuring both<br />
I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,<br />
Because what follows is pure innocence.<br />
I owe you much; and, like a wasteful youth,<br />
That which I owe is lost: but if you please<br />
To shoot another arrow that self way<br />
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br />
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,<br />
Or bring your latter hazard back again,<br />
And thankfully rest debtor for the first<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. You know me well; and herein spend but time,<br />
To wind about my love with circumstance;<br />
Then do but say to me what I should do,<br />
That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br />
And I am prest unto it:<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> therefore speak.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. In Belmont is a lady richly left,<br />
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br />
Of wond'rous virtues. Sometimes<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> from her eyes<br />
I did receive fair speechless messages:<br />
Her name is Portia; nothing undervalued<br />
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.<br />
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;<br />
For the four winds blow in from every coast<br />
Renowned suitors.<br />
O, my Antonio! had I but the means<br />
To hold a rival place with one of them,<br />
I have a mind presages me such thrift.<br />
That I should questionless be fortunate.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;<br />
Neither have I money, nor commodity<br />
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth,<br />
Try what my credit can in Venice do;<br />
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,<br />
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.<br />
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,<br />
Where money is; and I no question make,<br />
To have it of my trust, or for my sake.<br />
<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i>.<br />

<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> PORTIA <i>and</i> NERISSA.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is a-weary of this great
world.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same
abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are
as sick that surfeit with too much, as they that starve with nothing. It
is no small happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean; superfluity
comes sooner by white hairs,<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> but competency lives longer.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. Good sentences, and well pronounced.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. They would be better, if well followed.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels
had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a
good divine that follows his own instructions: I can easier teach twenty
what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own
teaching. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a
husband:&mdash;O me, the word choose! I may neither choose whom I would, nor
refuse whom I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the
will of a dead father:&mdash;Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose
one, nor refuse none?</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their death have
good inspirations; therefore, the lottery that he hath devised in these
three chests, of gold, silver, and lead (whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you), will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly, but one
who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection
towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest them I will
describe them; and according to my description level at my affection.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Por</i>. Ay, that's a colt, indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his
horse,<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> and he makes it a great approbation of his own good parts
that he can shoe him himself. </p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. Then, is there the county Palatine.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Por</i>. He doth nothing but frown; as who should say, '<i>An you will not
have me, choose;</i>' he hears merry tales, and smiles not: I fear he will
prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather to be married to a death's
head with a bone in his mouth, than to either of these. Heaven defend me
from these two!</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. Heaven made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Por</i>. Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober; and most vilely in
the afternoon, when he is drunk: when he is best he is a little worse
than a man; and when he is worst he is little better than a beast: an
the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
him.</p>
<br />

<p><i>Ner</i>. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you
should refuse to perform your father's will if you should refuse to
accept him.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of
Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for, if the devil be within, and
that temptation without, I know he will choose it.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; they have
acquainted me with their determinations: which is, indeed, to return to
their home and to trouble you with no more suit; unless you may be won
by some other sort than your father's imposition, depending on the
caskets.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is
not one among them hut I dote on his very absence, and I wish them a
fair departure.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a
scholar, and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of
Montferrat?</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think so was he called.</p>

<p><i>Ner</i>. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked
upon was the best deserving a fair lady.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. I remember him well; and I remember him worthy of thy
praise.&mdash;How now?&mdash;What news?</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> BALTHAZAR.</p>

<p><i>Ser</i>. The four strangers seek you, madam, to take their leave: and
there is a fore-runner come from a fifth, the prince of Morocco; who
brings word the prince, his master, will be here to-night.</p>

<p><i>Por</i>. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid
the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach.</p>

<p>Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</p>

<p>Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</p>

<p>[<i>Exeunt</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. Antonio is a good man.</p>

<p><i>Bas</i>. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. Oh no, no, no, no;&mdash;my meaning in saying he is a good man is, to
have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his means are in
supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another-to the Indies;
I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a
fourth for England; and other ventures he hath, squander'd abroad.<a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>

If I can catch him once upon the hip,<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a><br />

<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br />

About my monies, and my usances:<a name="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a><br />
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug;<br />
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe:<br />
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,<br />
And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,<br />
And all for use of that which is mine own.<br />
Well, then, it now appears you need my help:<br />
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say,<br />
'<i>Shylock, we would have monies</i>;' You say so;<br />
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,<br />
And foot me, as you spurn a stranger cur<br />
Over your threshhold; monies is your suit,<br />
What should I say to you? Should I not say<br />
'<i>Hath a dog money? is it possible<br />
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?</i>' or<br />
Shall I bend low, and in a bondman's key,<br />
With 'bated breath, and whispering humbleness,<br />
Say this,&mdash;<br />
'<i>Fair Sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;<br />
You spurn'd me such a day; another time<br />
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies<br />
I'll lend you thus much monies?</i>'<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. I am as like to call thee so again,<br />
To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.<br />
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br />
As to thy friends; (for when did friendship take<br />
A breed of barren metal of his friend?)<a name="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a><br />
But lend it rather to thine enemy;<br />
Who, if he break, thou may'st with better face<br />
Exact the penalties.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Why, look you, how you storm!<br />
I would be friends with you, and have your love;<br />
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with;<br />
Supply your present wants, and take no doit<br />
Of usance for my monies, and you'll not hear me:<br />
This is kind I offer.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. This were kindness.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. This kindness will I show:<br />
Go with me to a notary: seal me there<br />
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,<br />
If you repay me not on such a day,<br />
In such a place, such sum, or sums, as are<br />
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit<br />
Be nominated for an equal pound<br />
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken<br />
In what part of your body pleaseth me.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,<br />
And say, there is much kindness in the Jew.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. You shall not seal to such a bond for me<br />

<a name="HISTORICAL_NOTES_TO_ACT_FIRST"></a><h2>HISTORICAL NOTES TO ACT FIRST.</h2>
<br />

<p>(A) The foundation of Venice is attributed to the inhabitants of the
surrounding districts, who fled from the cruelty of Attila, King of the
Huns, and took refuge among the islets at the mouth of the Brenta. Here,
about the middle of the fifth century, they founded two small towns,
called Rivoalto and Malmocco, and, being in a manner shut out from all
other modes of employment, naturally devoted themselves to commerce. In
this way they soon became prosperous, and their numbers increased so
rapidly, that in the year 697 they made application to the Emperor to be
elected into a body politic, and obtained authority to elect a chief, to
whom they gave the name of Duke or Doge. The town, continuing to
increase, gradually extended its buildings to the adjacent islands, and,
at the same time, acquired considerable tracts of territory on the
mainland, then inhabited by the Veneti, from whence the rising city is
supposed to have borrowed its name of Venetia or Venice.</p>

<p>(B) This is the heart of Venice, and is one of the most imposing
architectural objects in Europe. Three of the sides are occupied by
ranges of lofty buildings, which are connected by a succession of
covered walk; or arcades. The church of St Mark, founded in the year
828, closes up the square on the east. The lofty Campanile, or
Bell-tower, over 300 feet in height, was begun A.D. 902, and finished in
1155.</p>

<p>In the reign of Justiniani Participazio, A.D., 827, the son and
Successor of Angelo, undistinguished by events of more important
character, the Venetians became possessed of the relics of that saint to
whom they ever afterwards appealed as the great patron of their state
and city. These remains were obtained from Alexandria by a pious
stratagem, at a time when the church wherein they were originally
deposited was about to be destroyed, in order that its rich marbles
might be applied to the decoration of a palace. At that fortunate
season, some Venetian ships (it is said no less than ten, a fact proving
the prosperous extent of their early commerce) happened to be trading in
that port; and their captains, though not without much difficulty,
succeeded in obtaining from the priests, who had the custody of the holy
treasure, its deliverance into their hands, in order that it might
escape profanation. It was necessary, however, that this transfer should
be made in secrecy; for we are assured by Sabellico, who relates the
occurrence minutely, that the miracles which had been daily wrought at
the saint's shrine had strongly attached the populace to his memory. The
priests carefully opened the cerements in which the body was enveloped;
and considering, doubtless, that one dead saint possessed no less
intrinsic virtue and value than another, they very adroitly substituted
the corpse of a female, Sta. Claudia, in the folds which had been
occupied by that of St. Mark. But they had widely erred in their
graduation of the scale of beatitude. So great was the odour of superior
sanctity, that a rich perfume diffused itself through the church at the
moment at which the grave-clothes of the evangelist were disturbed; and
the holy robbery was well nigh betrayed to the eager crowd of
worshippers, who, attracted by the sweet smell, thronged to inspect the
relics, and to ascertain their safety. After examination, they retired,
satisfied that their favourite saint was inviolate; for the slit which
the priests had made in his cerements was behind and out of sight. But
the Venetians still had to protect the embarkation of their prize. For
this purpose, effectually to prevent all chance of search, they placed
the body in a large basket stuffed with herbs and covered with joints of
pork. The porters who bore it were instructed to cry loudly '<i>Khanzri
Khanzir!</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and every true Mussulman whom they met, carefully avoided
the uncleanness with which he was threatened by contact with this
forbidden flesh. Even when once on board, the body was not yet quite
safe; for accident might reveal the contents of the basket; it was
therefore wrapt in one of the sails, and hoisted to a yard-arm of the
main-mast, till the moment of departure. Nor was this precaution
unnecessary; for the unbelievers instituted a strict search for
contraband goods before the vessel sailed. During the voyage, the ship
was in danger from a violent storm; and but for the timely appearance of
the saint, who warned the captain to furl his sails, she would
inevitably have been lost. The joy of the Venetians, on the arrival of
this precious cargo, was manifested by feasting, music, processions, and
prayers. An ancient tradition was called to mind, that St. Mark, in his
travels, had visited Aquileia; and having touched also at the Hundred
Isles, at that time uninhabited, had been informed, in a prophetic
vision, that his bones should one day repose upon their shores. Venice
was solemnly consigned to his protection. The saint himself, or his
lion, was blazoned on her standards and impressed on her coinage; and
the shout of the populace, whether on occasions of sedition or of joy,
and the gathering cry of the armies of the republic in battle was,
henceforward, '<i>Viva San Marco!'&mdash;Sketches of Venetian History</i>.</p>

<p>(C) This ancient Exchange &quot;where merchants most do congregate,&quot; is
situated on the Rialto Island, its name being derived from &quot;<i>riva alta,&quot;
&quot;high shore</i>.&quot; It is a square in the immediate vicinity of the Rialto
Bridge, and contains the Church of San Jacopo, the first sacred edifice
built in Venice. The original church was erected in the year 421, and
the present building in 1194, and was restored in 1531. This island,
being the largest and most elevated, became the first inhabited, and is,
therefore, the most ancient part of Venice. The Exchange was held under
the arcades, facing the church, and was daily crowded with those
connected with trade and commerce. It is now occupied as a vegetable
market.</p>

<p>(D) Vecellio informs us that the Jews of Venice differed in nothing, as
far as regarded dress, from Venetians of the same occupation, with the
exception of a yellow, or orange tawney coloured bonnet, which they were
compelled to wear by order of government.</p>

<p>The women were distinguished from the Christian ladies by Wearing yellow
veils.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is supposed to have taken the name of his Jew from an old
pamphlet, entitled &quot;Caleb Shillocke, his prophesie; or the Jewes
Prediction.&quot;</p>

<p>(E)</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;He lends out money gratis, and brings down<br /></span>
<span>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>About the time that Shakespeare lived, Venice had commercial dealings
with all the civilized nations of the world; and Cyprus, Candia, and the
Morea were subject to her government. Merchants from all countries
congregated in Venice, and received every possible encouragement from
the authorities.</p>

<p>The Jews, under the sanction of government, were the money lenders, and
were, consequently, much disliked, as well as feared, by their
mercantile creditors. They indulged in usury to an enormous extent, and
were immensely rich.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> LAUNCELOT GOBBO.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my
master: The fiend is at mine elbow, and tempts me; saying to
me,&mdash;<i>Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot, or good Gobbo, or good
Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away</i>:&mdash;My
conscience says,&mdash;<i>No: take heed, honest Launcelot; take heed, honest
Gobbo:</i> or (as aforesaid) <i>honest Launcelot Gobbo; do not run: scorn
running with thy heels</i>. Well the most courageous fiend bids me pack.
<i>Via</i>! says the fiend; <i>Away</i>! says the fiend, <i>for the heavens</i>;<a name="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
<i>rouse up a brave mind</i>, says the fiend, <i>and run</i>. Well, my conscience,
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, <i>my honest
friend, Launcelot, being an honest man's son</i>, or rather an honest
woman's son;&mdash;for, indeed, my father did something smack, something grow
to, he had a kind of taste;&mdash;well, my conscience says, <i>Launcelot, budge
not; budge</i>, says the fiend; <i>budge not</i>, says my conscience.
Conscience, say I, you counsel well; fiend, say I, you counsel well; to
be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew, my master, who
(Heaven bless the mark!) is a kind of devil; and to run away from the
Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the
devil himself. Certainly, the Jew is the very devil incarnation; and in
my conscience, my conscience is a kind of hard conscience, to offer to
counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment, I will
run.</p>

<p>[<i>As he is going out in haste</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> OLD GOBBO, <i>with a basket</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Master, young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to master
Jew's?</p>

<p><i>Lau. (aside.)</i> O heavens, this is my true-begotten father! who, being
more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,<a name="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> knows me not: I will try
conclusions<a name="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> with him.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Master young gentleman, I pray you which is the way to master
Jew's?</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Turn upon your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next
turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of
no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.<a name="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. 'Twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one
Launcelot that dwells with him, dwell with him, or no?</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>, Talk you of young master Launcelot?&mdash;mark me,
now&mdash;<i>(aside.)</i>&mdash;now will I raise the waters.<a name="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> Talk you of young
master Launcelot?</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. No master, sir: but a poor man's son: his father, though I say
it, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, Heaven be thanked, well to
live.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>, Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young master
Launcelot.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.<a name="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p><i>Lau. Ergo</i>, master Launcelot; talk not of master Launcelot, father; for
the young gentleman (according to fates and destinies, and such odd
sayings, the sisters three, and such branches of learning), is, indeed,
deceased; or, as you would say is plain terms, gone to heaven.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Marry, Heaven forbid! the boy was the very staff of my age, my
very prop.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Do I look like a cudgel, or a hovel-post, a staff, or a prop?&mdash;Do
you know me, father?</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but, I pray you
tell me, is my boy (rest his soul!) alive or dead?</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Do you not know me, father?</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Alack! sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing
me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will
tell you news of your son: Give me your blessing: <i>(kneels.)</i> Truth will
come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son may; but, in the
end, truth will out.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your
blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your
child that shall be,</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. I cannot think you are my son.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the
Jew's man; and I am sure Margery, your wife, is my mother.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn if thou be Launcelot,
thou art mine own flesh and blood. What a beard hast thou got: thou hast
got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin, my phill-horse,<a name="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> has on his
tail.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows backward; I am
sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face, when I last
saw him.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I
have brought him a present.</p>

<p><i>Lau. (rises.)</i> Give him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am
glad you are come: give me your present to one master Bassanio, who,
indeed, gives rare new liveries; if I serve not him, I will run as far
as Heaven has any ground.&mdash;O rare fortune! here comes the man;&mdash;to him,
father; for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> BASSANIO, <i>with</i> LEONARDO, <i>and</i> STEPHANO.</p>

<p><i>Bas</i>. See these letters deliver'd; put the liveries to making; and
desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit a</i> SERVANT.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. To him, father.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Heaven bless your worship!</p>

<p><i>Bas</i>. Gramercy! Would'st thou aught with me?</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Not a poor boy, sir; but the rich Jew's man; that would, sir, as
my father shall specify.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a
desire as my father shall specify.</p>

<p><i>Gob</i>. His master and he (saving your worship's reverence) are scarce
cater-cousins.</p>

<p><i>Lau</i>. To be brief, the very truth is, that the Jew having done me
wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall

<p>(A) Venice occupies 72 islands. There are 306 canals, traversed by
innumerable gondolas. The gondolas introduced in this scene are copied
from paintings of the same date as when the action of the play is
supposed to occur, and are, consequently, rather varied in shape from
those now seen in Venice. Besides the great squares of St. Mark, and the
adjoining Piazetta before the Doge's Palace, the city has numerous
narrow streets, or rather lanes, with small open spaces in front of the
churches, or formed by the termination of several alleys, leading to a
bridge. It is one of these spaces that is represented in the second act.</p>

<p>(B) &quot;Black Monday&quot; is Easter Monday, and was so called on this occasion.
In the 34th of Edward III. (1360), the 14th April, and the morrow after
Easter Day, King Edward, with his host, lay before the City of Paris,
which day was full dark of mist and hail, and so bitter cold that many
men died on their horse's backs with the cold.&mdash;<i>Stowe</i>.</p>

If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,<br />
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd;<br />
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,<br />
You must be gone from hence immediately.<br />

First, never to unfold to any one<br />
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail<br />
Of the right casket, never in my life<br />
To woo a maid in way of marriage; lastly,<br />
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,<br />
Immediately to leave you and be gone.<br />

Without the stamp of merit!<br />
O, that estates, degrees, and offices,<br />
Were not deriv'd corruptly! and that clear honour<br />
Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer!<br />
How many then should cover that stand bare?<br />
How many be commanded that command?<br />
And how much honour<br />
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times,<br />
To be new varnish'd? Well, but to my choice:<br />

<p><i>Enter</i> SALARINO <i>and</i> SALANIO.</p>

<i>Salar</i>. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;<br />
With him is Gratiano gone along;<br />
And in their ship, I am sure, Lorenzo is not.<br />
<br />
<i>Sal</i>. The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the duke;<br />
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.<br />
<br />
<i>Salar</i>. He came too late, the ship was under sail;<br />
But there the duke was given to understand,<br />
That in a gondola were seen together<br />
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica;<br />
Besides, Antonio certified the duke,<br />
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.<br />
<br />
<i>Sal</i>. I never heard a passion so confus'd,<br />
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,<br />
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets;<br />
&quot;<i>My daughter!&mdash;O, my ducats!&mdash;O, my daughter!<br />
Fled with a Christian!&mdash;O, my Christian ducats!&mdash;<br />
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter.!&quot;</i><br />
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,<br />
Or he shall pay for this.<br />

<p><i>Salar</i>. Marry, well remember'd: I reason'd<a name="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> with a Frenchman
yesterday, who told me that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wreck'd
on the narrow seas that part the French and English,&mdash;the Goodwins, I
think they call the place&mdash;a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the
carcases of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
report be an honest woman of her word.</p>

<p><i>Sal</i>. I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as ever knapp'd
ginger,<a name="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a
third husband: But it is true, that the good Antonio, the honest
Antonio,&mdash;O, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Salar</i>. Come, the full stop.</p>

<p><i>Sal</i>. Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.</p>

<p><i>Salar</i>. I would it might prove the end of his losses!</p>

<p><i>Sal</i>. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer; for here
he comes in the likeness of a Jew.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> SHYLOCK.</p>

<p><i>Salar</i>. How now, Shylock? what news among the merchants?</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter's
flight?</p>

<p><i>Sal</i>. That's certain. I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the
wings she flew withal.</p>

<p><i>Salar</i>. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledg'd; and
then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. She is damn'd for it.</p>

<p><i>Sal</i>. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. My own flesh and blood to rebel!</p>

<p><i>Salar</i>. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at
sea or no?</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare
scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that used to come so smug
upon the mart.&mdash;Let him look to his bond: he was wont to call me
usurer;&mdash;let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a
Christian courtesy;&mdash;let him look to his bond.</p>

<p><i>Sal</i>. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh?
What's that good for?</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else it will feed my
revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million; laughed
at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies: and what's his reason?
I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt
with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same
means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian
is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh?
if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? revenge: If a
Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian
example? why, revenge. The villany you teach me I will execute: and it
shall go hard but I will better the instruction.</p>

<p><i>Salar</i>. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be matched,
unless the devil himself turn Jew.</p>

<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> SALANIO, SALARINO, <i>and Servant</i>.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> TUBAL.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? hast thou found my
daughter?</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone, cost me two
thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till
now; I never felt it till now:&mdash;two thousand ducats in that; and other
precious, precious jewels.&mdash;I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
and the jewels in her ear! 'would she were hears'd at my foot, and the
ducats in her coffin! No news of them?&mdash;Why, so:&mdash;and I know not what's
spent in the search: Why, thou loss upon loss! the thief gone with so
much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but
o' my breathing; no tears but o' my shedding.</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. Yes, other men have ill luck, too. Antonio, as I heard in
Genoa,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. I thank God, I thank God:&mdash;Is it true? is it true?</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. I thank thee, good Tubal;&mdash;Good news, good news: ha! ha!&mdash;Where?
in Genoa?</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore
ducats!</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. Thou stick'st a dagger in me:&mdash;I shall never see my gold again:
Fourscore ducats at a sitting! fourscore ducats!</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice,
that swear he cannot choose but break.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture him; I am
glad of it.</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. One of them showed me a ring, that he had of your daughter for a
monkey.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise;<a name="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>
I had it of Leah, when I was a bachelor: I would not have given it for a
wilderness of monkeys.</p>

<p><i>Tub</i>. But Antonio is certainly undone.</p>

<p><i>Shy</i>. Nay, that's true, that's very true: Go, Tubal, fee me an officer,
bespeak him a fortnight before: I will have the heart of him, if he
forfeit; for were he out of Venice, I can make what merchandize I will.
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue: go, good Tubal; at our
synagogue, Tubal.</p>

I would be trebled twenty times myself.<br />

This house, these servants, and this same myself.<br />

That this same paper brings you.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. O sweet Portia,<br />
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words<br />
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,<br />
When I did first impart my love to you,<br />
I freely told you, all the wealth I had<br />
Ran in my veins,&mdash;I was a gentleman:<br />
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,<br />
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br />
How much I was a braggart: When I told you<br />
My state was nothing, I should then have told you<br />
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,<br />
I have engag'd myself to a dear friend,<br />
Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy,<br />
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;<br />
The paper as the body of my friend,<br />
And every word in it a gaping wound,<br />
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Solanio?<br />
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?<br />
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,<br />
From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?<br />

Besides, it should appear, that if he had<br />
The present money to discharge the Jew,<br />
He would not take it: Never did I know<br />
A creature that did bear the shape of man,<br />
So keen and greedy to confound a man<br />
He plies the duke at morning, and at night;<br />
And doth impeach the freedom of the state<br />
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,<br />

<br />
<i>Bas</i>. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,<br />
The best condition'd and unwearied spirit<br />
In doing courtesies, and one in whom<br />
The ancient Roman honour more appears,<br />
Than any that draws breath in Italy.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. What sum owes he the Jew?<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. For me, three thousand ducats.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. What, no more?<br />
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;<br />
Double six thousand, and then treble that,<br />
Before a friend of this description<br />
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.<br />
First, go with me to church, and call me wife:<br />
And then away to Venice to your friend!<br />
For never shall you stay by Portia's side<br />
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold<br />
To pay the petty debt twenty times over;<br />
When it is paid, bring your true friend along:<br />
My maid Nerissa, and myself, mean time,<br />
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away;<br />
For you shall hence, upon my wedding-day:<br />
But let me hear the letter of your friend.<br />

<p><i>Bas. (reads.)</i></p>

<p>'Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,
my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since, in
paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between
you and me, if I might but see you at my death: notwithstanding, use
your pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come, let not my
letter.'</p>

<i>Por</i>. O love, despatch all business, and be gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Since I have your good leave to go away,<br />
I will make haste: but, till I come again,<br />
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,<br />
Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.<br />
<br />

<p>(A) The present stone structure superseded an older one of wood. This
celebrated edifice was commenced in 1588.</p>

<p>(B) That the swan uttered musical sounds at the approach of death was
credited by Plato, Chrysippus, Aristotle, Euripides, Philostratus,
Cicero, Seneca, and Martial. Pliny, &AElig;lian, and Athen&aelig;us, among the
ancients, and Sir Thomas More among the moderns, treat this opinion as a
vulgar error. Luther believed in it. See his <i>Colloquia</i>, par. 2, p.
125, edit. 1571, 8vo. Our countryman, Bartholomew Glanville, thus
mentions the singing of the swan: &quot;And whan she shal dye and that a
fether is pyght in the brayn, then she syngeth, as Ambrose sayth,&quot; <i>De
propr. rer</i>. 1. xii., c. 11. Monsieur Morin has written a dissertation
on this subject in vol. v. of the <i>Mem. de l'acad. det inscript</i>. There
are likewise some curious remarks on it in Weston's <i>Specimens of the
conformity of the European languages with the Oriental</i>, p. 135; in
Seelen <i>Miscellanea</i>, tom. 1. 298; and in Pinkertoa's <i>Recollections of
Paris</i>, ii. 336.&mdash;<i>Douce's illustrations</i>.</p>

<p>(C) These two magnificent granite columns, which, adorn the Piazzetta of
St. Mark, on the Molo or Quay, near the Doge's Palace, were among the
trophies brought by Dominico Michieli on his victorious return from
Palestine in 1125; and it is believed that they were plundered from some
island in the Archipelago. A third pillar, which accompanied them, was
sunk while landing. It was long before any engineer could be found
sufficiently enterprising to attempt to rear them, and they were left
neglected on the quay for more than fifty years. In 1180, however,
Nicolo Barattiero<a name="FNanchor_A_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_95"><sup>[A]</sup></a>, a Lombard, undertook the task, and succeeded. Of
the process which he employed, we are uninformed; for Sabellico records
no more than that he took especial pains to keep the ropes continually
wetted, while they were strained by the weight of the huge marbles. The
Government, more in the lavish spirit of Oriental bounty, than in
accordance with the calculating sobriety of European patronage, had
promised to reward the architect by granting whatever boon, consistent
with its honour, he might ask.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether he quite strictly adhered to the requisite
condition, when he demanded that games of chance, hitherto forbidden
throughout the capital, might be played in the space between the
columns: perhaps with a reservation to himself of any profits accruing
from them. His request was granted, and the disgraceful monopoly became
established; but afterward, in order to render the spot infamous, and to
deter the population from frequenting it, it was made the scene of
capital executions; and the bodies of countless malefactors were thus
gibbeted under the very windows of the palace of the chief magistrate. A
winged lion in bronze, the emblem of St. Mark, was raised on the summit
of one of these columns; and the other was crowned with a statue of St.
Theodore, a yet earlier patron of the city, armed with a lance and
shield, and trampling on a serpent. A blunder, made by the statuary in
this group, has given occasion for a sarcastic comment from Amelot de la
Houssaye. The saint is sculptured with the shield in his right hand, the
lance in his left; a clear proof, says the French writer, of the
unacquaintance of the Venetians with the use of arms; and symbolical
that their great council never undertakes a war of its own accord, nor
for any other object than to obtain a good and secure peace. The
satirist has unintentionally given the republic the highest praise which
could flow from his pen. Happy, indeed, would it have been for mankind,
if Governments had never been actuated by any other policy. De la
Houssaye informs us also that the Venetians exchanged the patronage of
St. Theodore for that of St. Mark, from like pacific motives; because
the first was a soldier and resembled St. George, the tutelary idol of
Genoa.&mdash;<i>Sketches of Venetian History</i>.</p>

To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. With all my heart:&mdash;some three or four of you<br />
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.&mdash;<br />
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.<br />

<p>[<i>Herald reads</i>] &quot;Your grace shall understand, that, at the receipt of
your letter, I am very sick; but that in the instant that your messenger
came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Home; his name
is Balthasar: I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the
Jew and Antonio, the merchant: we turned o'er many books together; he is
furnished with my opinion; which, better'd with his own learning (the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with him, at my
importunity, to fill up your grate's request in my stead. I beseech you,
let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave
him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial all better publish his
commendation.&quot;</p>

<i>Duke</i>. You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:<br />
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.<br />
<br />
<i>Enter</i> PORTIA, <i>dressed like a Doctor of Laws</i>.<br />
<br />
Give me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I did, my lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. You are welcome: take your place.<br />
Are you acquainted with the difference<br />
That holds this present question in the court?<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I am informed throughly of the cause.<br />
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Is your name Shylock?<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Shylock is my name.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;<br />
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<br />
Cannot impugn you,<a name="FNanchor_104_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_105"><sup>[104]</sup></a> as you do proceed.&mdash;You<br />
stand within his danger,<a name="FNanchor_105_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_106"><sup>[105]</sup></a> do you not?<br />
<br />
[<i>To</i> ANTONIO,<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Ay, so he says.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. So you confess the bond?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. I do.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Then must the Jew be merciful.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. The quality of mercy is not strain'd;<a name="FNanchor_106_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_107"><sup>[106]</sup></a><br />
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven<br />
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;<br />
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes;<br />
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes<br />
The throned monarch better than his crown;<br />
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br />
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br />
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br />
But mercy is above this sceptred sway,<br />
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br />
It is an attribute to God himself;<br />
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br />
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br />
Though justice be thy plea, consider this&mdash;-That<br />
in the course of justice, none of us<br />
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br />
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br />
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much,<br />
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<br />
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br />
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>., My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<br />
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Is he not able to discharge the money?<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;<br />
Yea, thrice the sum: if that will not suffice,<br />
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,<br />
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:<br />
If this will not suffice, it must appear<br />
That malice bears down truth.<a name="FNanchor_107_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_108"><sup>[107]</sup></a> And I beseech you,<br />
Wrest once the law to your authority:<br />
To do a great right to do a little wrong;<br />
And curb this cruel devil of his will.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. It must not be; there is no power in Venice<br />
Can alter a decree established:<br />
'Twill be recorded for a precedent;<br />
And many an error, by the same example,<br />
Will rush into the state; it cannot be.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!<br />
O wise young judge, how do I honour thee!<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:<br />
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<br />
No, not for Venice.<br />

<i>Por</i>. Why, this bond is forfeit;<br />
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<br />
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br />
Nearest the merchant's heart:&mdash;Be merciful;<br />
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. When it is paid according to the tenour.<br />
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<br />
You know the law, your exposition<br />
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,<br />
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br />
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear,<br />
There is no power in the tongue of man<br />
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Most heartily I do beseech the court<br />
To give the judgment.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Why then, thus it is:<br />
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. O noble judge! O excellent young man!<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. For the intent and purpose of the law<br />
Hath full relation to the penalty,<br />
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!<br />
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Ay, his breast:<br />
So says the bond;&mdash;Doth it not, noble judge?&mdash;Nearest<br />
his heart, those are the very words.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh<br />
The flesh?<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. I have them ready.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,<br />
To stop his wounds, lest he should bleed to death.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Is it so nominated in the bond?<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. It is not so express'd; but what of that?<br />
'Twere good you do so much for charity.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Come, merchant, have you anything to say?<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. But little; I am arm'd and well prepar'd.&mdash;<br />
Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well!<br />
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;<br />
For herein fortune shows herself more kind<br />
Than is her custom: it is still her use,<br />
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br />
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow,<br />
An age of poverty: from which lingering penance<br />
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.<br />
Commend me to your honorable wife:<br />
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;<br />
Say, how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;<br />
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br />
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br />
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,<br />
And he repents not that he pays your debt;<br />
For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br />
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Antonio, I am married to a wife,<br />
Which is as dear to me as life itself;<br />
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,<br />
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life;<br />
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all<br />
Here to this devil, to deliver you.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. I have a wife, whom I protest I love;<br />
I would she were in heaven, so she could<br />
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. These be the Christian husbands: I have a daughter;<br />
Would any of the stock of Barrabas<a name="FNanchor_108_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_109"><sup>[108]</sup></a><br />
Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!  [<i>Aside</i>.<br />
We trifle time; I pray thee pursue sentence.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine;<br />
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Most rightful judge!<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast!<br />
The law allows it, and the court awards it.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Most learned judge!&mdash;A sentence; come, prepare.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Tarry a little;&mdash;there is something else.&mdash;<br />
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;<br />
The words expressly are a pound of flesh:<br />
Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;<br />
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br />
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<br />
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate<br />
Unto the state of Venice.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. O upright judge!&mdash;Mark, Jew!&mdash;O learned judge!<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Is that the law?<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Thyself shall see the act;<br />
For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd<br />
Thou shall have justice more than thou desir'st.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. O learned judge!&mdash;Mark Jew;&mdash;a learned judge!<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. I take his offer, then,&mdash;pay the bond thrice,<br />
And let the Christian go.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Here is the money.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Soft.<br />
The Jew shall have all justice;&mdash;soft;&mdash;no haste;&mdash;He<br />
shall have nothing but the penalty.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.(D)<br />
Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less, nor more,<br />
But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more,<br />
Or less, than a just pound,&mdash;be it but so much<br />
As makes it light or heavy in the balance,<br />
Or the division of the twentieth part<br />
Of one poor scruple,&mdash;nay, if the scale do turn<br />
But in the estimation of a hair,&mdash;<br />
Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!<br />
Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Give me my principal, and let me go.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. I have it ready for thee; here it is.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. He hath refus'd it in the open court;<br />
He shall have merely justice, and his bond.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!&mdash;<br />
thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Shall I not barely have my principal?<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,<br />
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Why then the devil give him good of it!<br />
I'll stay no longer question.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Tarry, Jew;<br />
The law hath yet another hold on you.<br />
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,&mdash;If<br />
it be proved against an alien,<br />
That by direct or indirect attempts<br />
He seek the life of any citizen,<br />
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive<br />
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half<br />
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;<br />
And the offender's life lies in the mercy<br />
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.<br />
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st:<br />
For it appears by manifest proceeding,<br />
That, indirectly, and directly, too,<br />
Thou hast contriv'd against the very life<br />
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd<br />
The danger formerly by me rehears'd.<br />
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. Beg that thou may'st have leave to hang thyself:<br />
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<br />
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;<br />
Therefore, thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. That thou shall see the difference of our spirit,<br />
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:<br />
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;<br />
The other half comes to the general state,<br />
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Ay, for the state;<a name="FNanchor_109_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_110"><sup>[109]</sup></a> not for Antonio.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that:<br />
You take my house, when you do take the prop<br />
That doth sustain my house; you take my life,<br />
When you do take the means whereby I live.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. A halter gratis; nothing else, for Heaven's sake.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. So please my lord the duke, and all the court,<br />
To quit the fine for one half of his goods;<br />
I am content, so he will let me have<br />
The other half in use,<a name="FNanchor_110_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_111"><sup>[110]</sup></a> to render it,<br />
Upon his death, unto the gentleman<br />
That lately stole his daughter;<br />
Two things provided more,&mdash;That for this favour,<br />
He presently become a Christian;<br />
The other, that he do record a gift,<br />
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,<br />
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. He shall do this; or else I do recant<br />
The pardon that I late pronounced here.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. I am content.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.<br />
<br />
<i>Shy</i>. I pray you give me leave to go from hence:<br />
I am not well; send the deed after me,<br />
And I will sign it.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. Get thee gone, but do it.<br />
<br />

Had I been judge, thou should'st have had ten more,<a name="FNanchor_111_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_112"><sup>[111]</sup></a><br />
To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font. <br />
<br />
[<i>Exit</i> SHYLOCK.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. Sir, I entreat you with me home to dinner.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I humbly do desire your grace of pardon.<br />
I must away this night toward Padua;<br />
And it is meet I presently set forth.<br />
<br />
<i>Duke</i>. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not:<br />
Antonio, gratify this gentleman;<br />
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.<br />
<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> DUKE, <i>Magnificoes, and Train</i>,<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend,<br />
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted<br />
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,<br />
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,<br />
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. And stand indebted, over and above,<br />
In love and service to you evermore.<br />

<i>Por</i>. He is well paid that is well satisfied:<br />
And I, delivering you, am satisfied,<br />
And therein do account myself well paid;<br />
My mind was never yet more mercenary.<br />
I pray you know me, when we meet again;<br />
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Dear Sir, of force I must attempt you further;<br />
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,<br />
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,<br />
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. You press me far, and therefore I will yield,<br />
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;<br />
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:&mdash;Do<br />
not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;<br />
And you in love shall not deny me this.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. This ring, good Sir,&mdash;alas, it is a trifle;<br />
I will not shame myself to give you this.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I will have nothing else but only this;<br />
And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. There's more depends on this than on the value.<br />
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,<br />
And find it out by proclamation;<br />
Only for this I pray you pardon me.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I see, Sir, you are liberal in offers:<br />
You taught me first to beg; and now, methinks,<br />
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Good Sir, this ring was given me by my wife;<br />
And when she put it on, she made me vow<br />
That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.<br />
An if your wife be not a mad woman,<br />
And know how well I have deserv'd this ring,<br />
She would not hold out enemy for ever,<br />
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!<br />
<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i> PORTIA <i>and</i> NERISSA.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. My lord Bassanio, let him have the ring;<br />
Let his deservings, and my love withal,<br />
Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;<br />
Give him the ring; and bring him, if thou can'st,<br />
Unto Antonio's house;&mdash;away, make haste.<br />
<br />
[<i>Exit</i> GRATIANO.<br />
<br />
Come, you and I will thither presently;<br />
And in the morning early will we both<br />
Fly toward Belmont: Come, Antonio.<br />
<br />
[<i>Exeunt</i>.<br />

<p>(A) This scene represents the Sala dei Preg&aacute;di, or Hall of the Senators.
In Venice the tribunal for criminal cases was composed of forty judges,
ordinarily presided over by one of three selected from the Council of
the Doge, and draughted for the most part, if not wholly, from the
members of the Senate. The Doge, who on all occasions was attended by
his particular officers, had the right of sitting in the councils, or on
the tribunal. The authority for the six senators in red (in this scene)
is taken from the picture at Hampton Court Palace, where the Doge of
Venice, in state, is receiving Sir Henry Wootton, ambassador from James
the First. The picture is by Odoardo Fialletti, better known as an
engraver than as a painter, and who was living at Venice when Sir Henry
Wootton was ambassador there.</p>

<p>(B) The first Doge, or Duke of Venice, was Paolo Luca Anafesto, elected
A.D. 697, and the last was Luigi Manini, who yielded the city, which had
just completed the eleventh century of its sway, to the victorious arms
of Buonaparte, in 1797.</p>

<p>(C) We are not to imagine the word <i>royal</i> to be only a ranting,
sounding epithet. It is used with great propriety, and shows the poet
well acquainted with the history of the people whom he here brings upon
the stage. For when the French and Venetians, in the beginning of the
thirteenth century, had won Constantinople, the French, under the.
Emperor Henry, endeavoured to extend their conquests into the provinces
of the Grecian Empire on the <i>Terra firma</i>; while the Veuetiaas, who
were masters of the sea, gave liberty to any subjects of the republic,
who would fit out vessels, to make themselves masters of the isles of
the Archipelago, and other maritime places; and to enjoy their conquests
in sovereignty: only doing homage to the republic for their several
principalities By virtue of this licence, the Sanudi, the Justinianii,
the Grimaldi, the Summaripi, and others, all Venetian <i>merchants</i>,
erected principalities in several places of the Archipelago (which their
descendants enjoyed for many generations), and thereby became truly and
properly <i>royal merchants</i>, which, indeed was the title generally given
them all over Europe. Hence, the most eminent of our own merchants
(while publick spirit resided amongst them, and before it was aped by
faction), were called <i>royal merchants</i>.&mdash;<i>Warburton</i>.</p>

<p>This epithet was in our poet's time more striking and better
understood, because Gresham was then commonly dignified with the title
of the <i>royal merchant.&mdash;Johnson</i>.</p>

<p>(D) This judgment is related by <i>Gracian</i>, the celebrated Spanish
Jesuit, in his <i>Hero</i>, with a reflection at the conclusion of it;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The vivacity of that great Turke enters into competition with that of
Solomon: a <i>Jew</i> pretended to cut an ounce of the flesh of a Christian
upon a penalty of usury; he urged it to the Prince, with as much
obstinacy, as perfidiousness towards God. The great Judge commanded a
pair of scales to be brought, threatening the <i>Jew</i> with death if he cut
either more or less: And this was to give a sharp decision to a
malicious process, and to the world a miracle of subtilty.&quot;&mdash;<i>The Hero</i>,
p. 24, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Gregorio Leti, in his <i>Life of Sixtus V</i>., has a similar story. The
papacy of Sixtus began in 1583. He died Aug. 29, 1590.&mdash;<i>Steevens</i></p>

For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br />
If any air of music touch their ears,<br />
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br />
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,<br />
By the sweet power of music. Therefore, the poet<br />
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;<br />
Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br />
But music for the time doth change his nature:<br />
The man that hath no music in himself,<br />
Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,<br />

[GRATIANO <i>and</i> NERISSA <i>seem to talk apart</i>.<br />

Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.<br />
<br />

That she did give to me; whose posy was<br />
For all the world, like cutler's poetry<a name="FNanchor_118_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_119"><sup>[118]</sup></a><br />
Upon a knife,  '<i>Love me, and leave me not</i>.'<br />
<br />
<i>Ner</i>. What talk you of the posy, or the value?<br />
You swore to me, when I did give it you,<br />
That you would wear it till the hour of death:<br />
And that it should lie with you in your grave;<br />
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br />
You should have been respective,<a name="FNanchor_119_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_120"><sup>[119]</sup></a> and have kept it.<br />
Gave it a judge's clerk!&mdash;but well I know,<br />
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. He will, an if he live to be a man.<br />
<br />
<i>Ner</i>. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,&mdash;<br />
kind of boy; a little scrubbed boy,<a name="FNanchor_120_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_121"><sup>[120]</sup></a><br />
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk;<br />
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee;<br />
I could not for my heart deny it him.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. You were to blame, I must be plain with you,<br />
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:<br />
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,<br />
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<br />
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear<br />
Never to part with it; and here he stands,&mdash;<br />
I dare be sworn for him, he would not leave it,<br />
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth<br />
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<br />
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;<br />
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,<br />
And swear, I lost the ring defending it.<br />
<br />
[<i>Aside</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Gra</i>. My lord Bassanio gave his ring away<br />
Unto the judge that begg'd it, and, indeed,<br />
Deserv'd it, too; and then the boy, his clerk,<br />
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine:<br />
And neither man, nor master, would take aught<br />
But the two rings.<br />

<i>Por</i>. What ring gave you, my lord;<br />
Not that, I hope, which you receiv'd of me.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. If I could add a lie unto a fault,<br />
I would deny it; but you see, my finger<br />
Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Even so void is your false heart of truth.<br />
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your sight<br />
Until I see the ring.<br />
<br />
<i>Ner</i>. Nor I in yours,<br />
Till I again see mine.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Sweet Portia,<br />
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br />
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,<br />
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,<br />
And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br />
When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br />
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br />
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br />
Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br />
You would not then have parted with the ring.<br />
What man is there so much unreasonable,<br />
If you had pleas'd to have defended it<br />
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br />
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br />
Nerissa teaches me what to believe;<br />
I'll die for't, but some woman had the ring.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. No, by mine honour, madam, by my soul,<br />
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br />
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,<br />
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him,<br />
And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away;<br />
Even he that had held up the very life<br />
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br />
I was enforc'd to send it after him.<br />
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd<br />
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:<br />
Since he hath got the jewel that I lov'd,<br />
And that which you did swear to keep for me,<br />
I will become as liberal as you.<br />

<i>Ant</i>. I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;<br />
And in the hearing of these many friends,<br />
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<br />
I never more will break an oath with thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. I once did lend my body for his wealth;<a name="FNanchor_121_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_122"><sup>[121]</sup></a><br />
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,<br />
<br />
[<i>To</i> PORTIA.<br />
<br />
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,<br />
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<br />
Will never more break faith advisedly.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. Then you shall be his surety: give him this;<br />
And bid him keep it better than the other.<br />
<br />
<i>Ant</i>. Here, lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.<br />
<br />
<i>Bas</i>. By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor!<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio.<br />
<br />

For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,<br />
Did give me this.<br />
<br />

In summer, when the ways are fair enough.<br />
<br />
<i>Por</i>. You are all amaz'd:<br />
Here is a letter, read it at your leisure;<br />
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:<br />
There you shall find, that Portia was the doctor;<br />
Nerissa there, her clerk: Lorenzo here<br />

And but e'en now return'd; I have not yet<br />
Enter'd my house.&mdash;Antonio, you are welcome;<br />

For here I read for certain, that my ships<br />
Are safely come to road.<br />

My clerk Has some good comforts too for you.<br />

<p>THE END.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p>At a very early period, Venice had begun to trade with Constantinople
and the Levant, and though subjected to formidable competition from the
Pisans and Genoese, succeeded in engrossing the far largest share of the
traffic of the East. The Crusades now commenced, and giving lucrative
employment to their shipping in the conveyance of troops, and the
munitions of war, greatly increased both their wealth and power, and
enabled them to make large additions to their territory. In early times,
the Doges had been elected by the popular voice, and held their office
by a very precarious tenure; for, in the case of any reverse or general
dissatisfaction from any other cause, they were not only deposed, but
often lost their lives, either by open violence, or assassination. The
disorders thus occasioned rose to such a height in the 12th century,
that a change in the form of government became necessary. For this
purpose the city was divided into six districts, each of which nominated
two delegates, or twelve in all; these twelve nominated 470
representatives, who concentrated in themselves all the powers which had
been previously exercised by the popular assemblies. At the same time, a
senate was appointed, and the Doge was provided with a council of six,
who were nominally to assist, but, if so disposed, could easily find
means to thwart him. The 470 representatives formed the grand council,
and receiving their appointments annually from 12 delegates chosen by
the popular voice, continued, in fact, notwithstanding the change in
form, to be dependent upon it. The next change, however, set them free.
After a severe struggle, the 470, in 1319, succeeded in making their
office hereditary, and thus converted what had previously been a
democracy into one of the most rigid forms of aristocracy. The evils of
the system soon developed themselves. The 470, now hereditary nobles,
became as jealous of each other as they had formerly been of the people,
and while appropriating all the great offices of the state, had recourse
to various methods, many of them of the most despotic nature, to prevent
anyone of the great families from acquiring a preponderating influence.
Among these arrangements was the institution of a council of 10,
selected from the grand council, and subsequently, in 1454, the
selection of three state inquisitors from the council of 10. These
inquisitors, in whom all the powers of the state were absolutely vested,
justified the name which the cruel bigotry of the Romish Church has
established. This rigid despotism had, however, the effect of giving a
stern unity of purpose to the proceedings of government, and doubtless
contributed in some degree to consolidate the various accessions of
territory which had been made into one whole. At this period the
Venetians were masters of the coast of Dalmatia, and the islands of
Cyprus, Candia, and a great part of the Morea, and had almost
monopolized the trade of Egypt and the East. The first great attempt to
humble Venice was made in the beginning of the 16th century, when the
famous league of Cambrai, of which Pope Julius the Second was the real
author, though the Emperor of Germany, and the kings of France and Spain
were parties to it, was framed for the avowed purpose of completely
subduing her, and partitioning her territories. Dissensions among the
confederates more than her own valour saved her from destruction, but
not before most of her possessions on the mainland had been wrested from
her. A still heavier blow at her prosperity was struck, by the discovery
of a new passage to the East, which carried its rich traffic into new
channels, and dried up one of the main sources of her wealth and
strength. The work of destruction was all but completed by the Turks,
who engaged her in an expensive and ruinous warfare, during which she
lost the Morea, the islands of Cyprus and Candia, and with them the
ascendancy which she had long possessed in the Levant. From all these
causes her decline proved as rapid as her rise had been, and though her
position can hardly fail to give her a considerable coasting trade, all
her maritime greatness has departed, and apparently the highest destiny
to which she can now aspire, is that of being a valuable dependency to
some superior power.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
